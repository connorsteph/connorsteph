Welcome! I'm a master's student at the University of Alberta specializing in statistical machine learning (defending Halloween 2022ðŸŽƒ).
  
My background is an undergraduate degree in physics, researching topics such as **ab initio quantum chemistry** and using computation
to test theoretical models of superconductivity before making the short hop over to computing science. I've conducted research in assistive robotics and had the 
incredibly cool experience of implementing a new control scheme on a robotic arm. The focus of my research in graduate school has been
studying optimal sequential decision making, specifically problems that fit under the description of <b>pure exploration in multi-armed bandits</b>. Recently
I've come full circle, working as a research intern at the European Space Agency (ESA) Advanced Concepts Team(ACT), developing **deep learning** models to
identify/predict chaos in dynamical systems as well as identifying dynamical systems from sparse data.
